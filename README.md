# Coffee-Shop-Sales analysis using Excel

☕ Coffee Shop Sales Analysis


📌 Project Overview


This project analyzes coffee shop sales data to uncover key trends, performance metrics, and actionable insights. Using Excel, I performed data extraction, cleaning, transformation, modeling, and analysis before visualizing the findings in an interactive dashboard.

The analysis highlights customer footfall patterns, peak sales hours, top-selling products, and store location performance, ultimately helping identify opportunities for improved operational efficiency and revenue growth.


🛠️ Steps & Methodology



Extracted Data – Gathered raw sales data from the coffee shop’s point-of-sale records.

Data Cleaning – Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized data formats.

Data Transformation – Created calculated fields, time-based aggregations, and category groupings.

Data Modeling – Built relationships between sales, products, time, and store locations for structured analysis.

Data Analysis – Identified trends in sales, customer footfall, product preferences, and location performance.

Dashboard Creation – Designed an interactive Excel dashboard to visualize key metrics and insights.

Executive Summary – Compiled actionable recommendations for operational and marketing improvements.


📊 Key Findings



Peak Sales Hours:

Highest order volume between 8 AM - 10 AM, with a smaller spike between 3 PM - 5 PM.

Suggests morning commuters and afternoon snack/coffee breaks drive sales.

Friday, Thursday, and Monday have the highest customer traffic (~21,600–21,700 visitors).

Saturday shows the lowest traffic, indicating potential for weekend promotions.

Store Performance:

Hell’s Kitchen slightly outperformed Astoria and Lower Manhattan, with ~$236K in sales.

Lower Manhattan lagged slightly, suggesting a need for localized strategies.
